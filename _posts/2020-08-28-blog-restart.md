## Why (re)start a blog in 2020?

I'm not starting a blog. This page [was here]({% link _posts/2016-09-09-test1.md %}) since the site was built 4 years ago, because the engine behind the website, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), was developed for blogs.

Why to reactivate it now? A simple answer to this fair question is: I want to capture my thoughts on my intellecutal endeavors: research and teaching in organic chemistry at the university level. My hope is that my efforts here will be regular. Let's wait and see.
