<h1 id="what-is-this-course-about">What is this course about</h1>
<p>CHEM 128A is the first part of a two-semester sequence in organic chemistry, the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds. Topics in this course will be focused on the principles of bonding, structure, reactivity, and synthesis of organic materials. Also, a significant portion of this course will address the analytical techniques routinely used by organic chemists in their research. While learning these fundamental aspects of organic chemistry, I hope it will become apparent that this science is central to the practice and understanding of many other disciplines. Lectures and problems will often feature organic compounds and reactions in the context of biology, pharmacy, medicine, materials, and energy and fuel science.</p>
<h1 id="what-will-you-learn">What will you learn</h1>
<p>Students who successfully complete the course should be able to (1) clearly communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions; and (2) to be able to analyze chemical structures and reactions to make and defend predictions about chemical processes. Learning activities and assignments in this course are designed to help you achieve these two goals.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-my-expectations">What are my expectations?</h1>
<p><strong>I want you to be successful in this course.</strong> I will do my utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning environment based on challenge and support and giving my highest professional commitment to your success and well-being. But, <strong>I cannot achieve success for you</strong>. Success in college courses comes from cooperation with instructors, interaction with your classmates, and diligent effort throughout the semester. I like to compare successfull classroom interactions to interactions between players and coaches on a sports team. Players do the work and coaches make sure players do the work that helps players succeed.</p>
<p>To be successful in the course, you need to make sure you are always giving an effort to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare for the class through the pre-class learning exercises (<a href="#pre-class-ec">described below</a>).</li>
<li>Attend all class meetings and participate actively in class activities.</li>
<li>Be proactive in completing course work and avoid procrastination in all things.</li>
<li>Maintain awareness of course announcements and calendar events at all times, by regularly checking email, Piazza, and the course calendar.</li>
<li>Take initiative to seek out help when you are stuck or have a question using office visits, Piazza posts, study groups, and whatever else works for you.</li>
<li>Maintain a positive attitude about the class and what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many strategies to study Organic Chemistry. The hardest and one I don't recommend is rote memorization. There will be a lot of new words, definitions, names, and structures that you will have to commit to memory. Memorizing everything, however, is nearly impossible because the amount of material that is covered increases dramatically as the semester progresses. Understanding of the trends, principles, connections, and logic of chemical transformation will give you better chances of success. I suggest you take a look <a href="http://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/blog">recommendations and tips from students who took the class in the past</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-expectations-about-your-general-chemistry-knowledge">My expectations about your general chemistry knowledge</h2>
<p>Organic Chemistry is a hard course because it discusses chemistry from a different perspective than it is done in introductory courses you took so far. What you're used to seeing in General Chemistry all the time: formulae, calculations, units, you will seldom see in this course. General Chemistry is to a large extent a course in <em>quantitative</em> thinking. I expect that you know how to calculate thermodynamic enthalpies and entropies if you have to. It is far more important to me, however, that you come to my class knowing the following things intuitively:</p>
<ul>
<li>how concentration change affects the equilibrium;</li>
<li>how concentration change affects the rate of the reaction;</li>
<li>what happens to Gibbs energy of a reaction when temperature is varied; and</li>
<li>how electronegativity, electron affinity, ionic radius, etc. change as you go across the periodic table</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <em>qualitative</em> understanding of chemical phenomena and Organic Chemistry mostly that. I expect that you do. To make sure we're on the same page, first two class meetings will focus on how things you learned in General Chemistry tie into Organic Chemistry.</p>
<h1 id="what-will-you-do-to-learn">What will you do to learn?</h1>
<p>Learning happens by doing, not just by listening. So to reach the learning goals in this course, you’ll be doing a wide variety of <em>active learning</em> tasks both in and outside of class.</p>
<p><strong>Outside of class.</strong> Before the class meeting, you will work actively to get your first contact with new concepts by reading the textbook, watching videos, and completing all structured Skill Builder Exercises. Then, you will put your best effort to complete the WileyPLUS assignments. Then, following class meetings, you’ll be working on problems that ask you to extend the basics by solving both theoretical and applied problems from the textbook.</p>
<p><strong>In class.</strong> You’ll be working with you classmates to make sense of concepts and work on creative applications of those basics through group problem-solving sessions, presentations of solutions to the class, discussions driven by interactive polling activities, and more. All of the work you do in class is carefully designed to promote learning of the concepts of the course.</p>
<h2 id="learning-targets-and-assessments">Learning targets and assessments</h2>
<p>The content and the skills you will learn in the course are given in a <a href="#learning-targets">list of 16 Learning Targets</a> (LTs). The list is appended to the end of the syllabus. During the course, you’ll be expected to provide evidence that you can perform the tasks that are given in the Learning Targets by completing Learning Target Assessments (LTAs). These will be short quizzes, each addressing a single Learning Target. For example, the assessment for the Learning Target 1.4 (“I can use words and drawings to read and communicate stereochemical information”) may consist of questions that will ask you to demonstrate that skill.</p>
<p>Learning Target Assessments are graded either <em>satisfactory</em> or <em>unsatisfactory</em>. What constitutes <em>satisfactory</em> or <em>unsatisfactory</em> work will be spelled out explicitly for each Learning Target and made known to you in advance. See the section about the <a href="#grading-system">grading system</a> for information on how to retake Learning Target assessment that is marked <em>unsatisfactory</em>.</p>
<p>Your mastery of basic skills will also be assessed through a comprehensive ACS exam given during finals week. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed by the American Chemical Society.</p>
<h2 id="pre-class-ec">Pre-class assignments and engagement credits</h2>
<p><em>Engagement</em> in the course means preparing well for class and participating productively both in and outside of class. The more engaged you are in the class, the better you will learn the material; conversely, students who disengage and try to complete the course from a distance generally have a hard time succeeding.</p>
<p>Your level of engagement in the course will be measured by earning <em>engagement credits</em>. An engagement credit will be awarded for such accomplishments as completion of pre-class online assignments, participation in clicker questions, giving a particularly useful comment in an online discussion (Piazza) in between classes, or even asking an insightful question in class or during office hours. Some engagement credit opportunities may be announced in advance, but many will be unannounced, and you will need to be present in class and present online to earn them.</p>
<p>This class is designed according to flipped learning model. Pre-class readings, videos, and Skill Builder problems provide you with a structured introduction to the basic ideas of new material so that we don’t have to spend a lot of time in class doing lectures on this material. Completing the online assignments serves two roles. First, it gives you an idea what is the level of mastery you achieved thus far. Second, guides my decisions about what activities to plan and what concepts to focus on in the upcoming class meetings.</p>
<p>Pre-class assignments are graded <em>satisfactory</em> or <em>unsatisfactory</em>, and completion of a pre-class assignment package earns one engagement credit. <em>Satisfactory</em> if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All assignments (sometimes there will be multiple) is submitted before the deadline, which is 24 hours before the class meeting (2:00 pm Pacific). Submissions past this deadline will be automatically marked <em>unsatisfactory</em>.</li>
<li>Every exercise has a response that shows a good-faith effort to be right. Submissions that have exercises where a good-faith effort to be right is not evident, for example, if the response is “I don’t know,” “I don’t understand,” answered with a semantically incorrect statement, or answered with a random guess, will be automatically marked <em>unsatisfactory</em>. If you are indeed stuck on a question, you are expected to give yourself enough advance time to ask a question about it in office hours, in group work with others, or on Piazza discussion board.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that <strong>correctness is not factored into the grade</strong>, so you should feel free to give your best effort on each one without fear of being counted off for wrong answers. In fact, misconceptions about the material are part of what online assignments are set up to collect so we can work on them in class.</p>
<h3 id="participation-in-clicker-questions">Participation in clicker questions</h3>
<p>Research shows that student response systems (clickers) help students learn more and do better in the course. I will use the <code>i&gt;clicker</code> student response system in class to assess your learning. Students must respond to at least 75% of questions on a particular day to earn participation in the session. Participation in at least 35% of sessions earns 1 EC, and each additional 5% of participation earns additional EC up to 12 EC for participation in 90% of sessions.</p>
<h1 id="grading-system">Grading system</h1>
<p>CHEM 128A uses a points-free mastery-based grading system that is designed to provide you with control over the grading process, clear overview your progress toward a course grade, and a final course grade that truly reflects your actual mastery of course concepts. Completion of a learning unit will be followed by a short 10–15 min in-class quiz (typically at the beginning of the class period) that test your level of mastery.</p>
<p>Our grading system works as follows. At the beginning of the semester, you will be able to decide on the target grade you plan to earn for the course. This does not need to be an “A.” You’ll be asked to carefully consider your goals, skill set, life situation, academic needs, and so on before stating your target grade. For some students, a “B” or even a “C” is perfectly sufficient and realistic, relative to their situation.</p>
<p>Your graded work will be evaluated without using points. Instead, your work will be graded either <em>satisfactory</em> or <em>unsatisfactory</em>. Whenever you submit work to be graded, I will employ my best professional judgment along with a clear list of specifications for categorizing that work. The specifications are listed at the end of the syllabus, and you should make yourself intimately familiar with that document. Each quiz will have clear explanation how to earn <em>satisfactory</em> mark.</p>
<p>The grade you earn at the end of the semester is determined by counting the number of items in each category that you complete at an acceptable level. There are no points involved and no statistical or numerical calculations (a.k.a. grading on a curve). To earn a grade you need to accomplish all aspects of the grade (see table below). For reference: there is a total of 16 LTAs, opportunity to earn at least 48 engagement credits and a final ACS exam (70 multiple choice questions).</p>

<h3 id="retakes">You will have multiple attempts to pass LTAs</h3>
<p>At the heart of the learning process in CHEM 128A is a system of revision of your work that will allow multiple attempts to demonstrate a <em>satisfactory</em> level of learning. Grades on LTAs are not ﬁnal until the end of the semester and can be attempted again. However, some restrictions apply and are explained below.</p>
<p>There will be times set aside during the semester for you to make up LTAs for which you didn’t earn satisfactory mark. In-class make-ups are scheduled on 9/14 and 12/05. There will be additional make-up dates announced but will happen outside of class time. Make-ups will also be available during faculty consultation days (Dec. 7–8).</p>
<p>Second attempt to pass an LTA is free.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A <a href="#tokens">token</a> must be spent on each subsequent attempt. Details on how to request a retake of an LTA will be presented on Blackboard.</p>
<h3 id="tokens">Tokens</h3>
<p>Tokens are a “currency” in the course that you can use to purchase exceptions to some course rules, especially the rules for retakes. Each student begins the course with eight tokens, and tokens can purchase any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>one token buys a third, fourth, etc. attempt at passing a Learning Target Assessment; and</li>
<li>two tokens buy one engagement credit</li>
</ul>
<p>Opportunities to earn more tokens may be made available during the semester.</p>
<h1 id="course-policies">Course policies</h1>
<h2 id="lta-make-up-policy">LTA make-up policy</h2>
<p>If you know in advance that you will miss an LTA (first attempt), and have a valid reason that can be verified by a document (e.g. a doctor's letter, or a letter from an athlete's sports team coach), I will decide on an individual basis. Notify me as soon as you confirm that you will not be able to take an LTA and I will arrange an alternative date/time, and you will take it.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-the-course">Dropping the course</h2>
<p>Students may drop classes using the on-line system through Monday, September 12. Between September 13 and 19, the Drop/Withdrawal Form, signed by instructor and department chair is needed to drop a course but no record will be registered in student transcript. Serious and compelling drop period begins Tuesday, September 20 and ends on November 14. More details on <a href="http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html">Admissions web pages</a></p>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable &quot;serious and compelling reason&quot; within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h1 id="university-policies-and-disclaimers">University policies and disclaimers</h1>
