# Research Opportunities

The HMLab conducts research on the exciting problem in chemistry: _how to synthesize important molecules in the most efficient and sustainable way_.

We are constantly looking for hard-working early-career scientists to join the team! If you want to get a taste of real organic chemistry research in an active laboratory doing externally-funded research, this is a place for you.

## Are You Interested?

Undergraduate students who are interested in conducting research for credit or as an extracurricular activity should [contact me by e-mail][mailto] or talk to me in person. My office is in Science 1, room 352. There is a small selection process because because the space in the research lab is limited. Although most students do not begin research until they have completed first semester of organic chemistry it is not a hard requirement.
