# Research Opportunities

We occasionally have openings for talented undergraduate and post-baccalaureate student researchers in my laboratory. Sometimes these openings turn into paid student assistant positions. This is an exciting opportunity for students wishing to get a taste of real organic chemistry research in an active laboratory doing externally-funded research, often as a precursor to graduate/professional school.

As quite a few people express interest, and we have limited lab space and fume hoods, we are required to be somewhat selective in students we consider.

## Why else must we be selective?

1. Organic chemistry research requires a demonstrated understanding of organic chemistry principles. I require of my students a working knowledge of the structure of organic compounds, mechanisms, reactions, and analytical methods (NMR, chromatography, etc.).
2.  Organic lab research requires at least a cursory starting knowledge of fundamental organic lab techniques: TLC, flash chromatography, distillation, NMR spectra interpretation, following reactions, etc.
3. Good science requires good communication skills and the ability to think logically.

More than anything, training students takes tremendous time for everyone involved. With the very little space we have available, we need to ensure students we accept are a good fit to the goals of the research lab and have sufficient commitment to performing research.

## Requirements

Our current minimum requirements for incoming organic chemistry research students are:

1. Having taken all of the core organic lecture and lab courses: CHEM128 and CHEM 129.
2. Reasonable grades in the science/chemistry lab and lecture courses (B or greater, with some flexibility).
3. Our lab is highly dependent on computers. You should be comfortable with ChemDraw or equivalent, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.
4. Enrollment in CHEM190 (undergrads) or CHEM290 (MS students) the entire time you are in the lab. I expect a commitment of 4-6 hours per week for each unit of CHEM190 (12–16 for CHEM290) but not all that has to be spent in the lab.

## How to apply?

Write a 1–2-page document that addresses the ideas below. The format isn’t important, but the content is.

Send the document by [email][mailto] (in DOC or PDF format) to hmuchalski (at) csufresno (dot) edu.

There is no deadline. Applications are considered throughout the year. If the lab is full, and a position opens up, we may ask you to update your application at a later time.

### Who are you?

Introduce yourself. Tell me what is your major, year, etc. Chemistry and Biochemistry majors receive a slight priority over non-Chemistry majors.

Include the relevant science courses you have you taken, which grades you received. (If not at Fresno State, tell where you took them and with whom). This information can be listed or tabulated. Mention which relevant courses do you plan to take next semester?

### What is your current schedule?

Briefly, mention your current and upcoming schedule and tentative times you would be available to do research. At very least: how many days a week, and a rough number of hours per week.

Mention other significant commitments (internships and work). These are not frowned upon, but being overwhelmed with other obligations is an indicator that students will not be productive in the lab.

### When are you graduating or leaving FS?

To make a reasonable contribution to a research project, we typically require a 1–2-year commitment.

### Why do you want to perform research?

- What is the next step in your career path?
- How will performing research integrate or help you with your next step?
- Do you intend to get an advanced degree? If so, what sort of degree do you want?  Also, if you are coming in with research funding, please mention this. (One paragraph is sufficient for this section)

### What is your favorite reaction and lab technique?

We are an organic chemistry research laboratory full of individuals excited about organic chemistry. Tell us what reaction and what lab technique is your favorite.

### Can you write?

Submit one example of a writing assignment that you feel demonstrates your writing abilities (it should be science related, like a lab report that you feel happy with). It should be 4 or more pages.
