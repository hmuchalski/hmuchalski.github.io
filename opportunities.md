## What do we do?

We conduct research on the most exciting problems in organic chemistry: _how to synthesize important molecules in the most efficient and sustainable way_. We are constantly looking for hard-working early-career scientists to join the team. If you want to get a taste of real organic chemistry research in an active laboratory doing externally-funded research, this is a place for you.

## Are You Interested?

Undergraduate students who are interested in conducting research for credit should visit me during office hours (preferred) or contact me by e-mail. My office is in room 352 of the Science Building (Science 1). Although most students do not begin research until they have completed first semester of organic chemistry it is not a hard requirement.

## Expectations

To learn more about lab culture and what you can expect when you join our team [read this page][hmlab-os] ([PDF][hmlab-os-pdf]). If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask Dr. Muchalski.
