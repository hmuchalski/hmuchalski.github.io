This research area focuses on the process of discovery and development of new reactions and synthetic strategies for preparation of important molecular motifs. Our interest lies in compounds that find application as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials.

## Metal-Catalyzed Synthesis of Heterocycles

This project explores use of palladium and gold complexes as catalysts for preparation of benzo-fused heterocycles. Our past publications focused on synthesis of benzothiophenes and benzofurans from diaryl alkynes that carry nucleophilic functional groups (sulfides, ethers, etc.). These groups can be *‘encouraged’* to engage with the alkyne in a cyclization reaction and we found that cationic gold complexes with *N*-heterocyclic carbene ligands are particularly persuasive.

## Green and Sustainable Chemistry 

More recently we put greater emphasis on sustainability of the reactions we do. Some of the questions that guide our efforts are:

- How can we limit or eliminate the use of hazardous solvents?
- Can we reduce the amount of catalyst needed to carry out the reaction?
- What is the scope and limitations of the reaction?
- What is the mechanism?
- How can we leverage our understanding of the mechanism to improve the reaction?

We are currently looking for ways to do this chemistry in ways that aligns with the Principles of Green and Sustainable Chemistry. Our strategies include aqueous micellar media, development of robust catalysts, and combining multiple reactions into one-pot processes.
