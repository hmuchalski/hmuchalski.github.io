Our main goal is to increase the body of knowledge in the area of organic chemistry while also training the next generation of scientists. Our research aims can be bundled in three areas:

1. Understanding of reaction mechanisms and their kinetic profiles.
2. Discovery and development of new reactions.
3. Design and development of experiments for organic chemistry laboratory courses.

## Kinetics of Peroxidation

The free radical reaction of molecular oxygen with weak C–H bonds that leads to hydroperoxides (ROOH), known as autoxidation to chemists and peroxidation to biochemists, is the key reaction that leads to oxidative degradation of hydrocarbon-rich materials. For example, autoxidation causes plastics to become ‘cloudy’ over time due to exposure to UV light and oxygen in air (image below).

Autoxidation is a radical chain reaction. Carbon-centered radicals (R•) rapidly react with molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical (R-OO•). Peroxyl radical is capable of removing a hydrogen atom from a susceptible organic molecule to form organic hydroperoxide (R-OOH) and regenerate the carbon-centered radical (R•). 


Peroxidation can be inhibited by providing a competitive substrate (antioxidant) that breaks the chain process. Knowledge of rate constants of autoxidation is key in development of antioxidants, molecules that trap the chain-propagating peroxyl radical and inhibit or terminate autoxidation. 

### Peroxyl Radical Clocks

Use of peroxyl radical clocks is one of the leading experimental approaches used in determination of rate constants of H-atom transfer from substrate to peroxyl radical. Current peroxyl radical clocks rely exclusively on chromatography-based analytical tools where resolution of analytes depends on many instrument-dependent factors (adsorbent, mobile phase, detector, analyte volatility, UV absorption, etc.). In recent years quantitative NMR (qNMR) spectroscopy has emerged as an attractive analytical method due to the fact that it is simple to adopt and is non-destructive to the sample. The aim of this project is to develop a peroxyl radical clock method that uses quantitative heteronuclear NMR for compound analysis.

## Synthetic Methodology Projects

This research area focuses on the process of discovery and development of new reactions and synthetic strategies for preparation of important molecular motifs. Our interest lies in compounds that find application as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. More recently we put greater emphasis on sustainability of the reactions we do. Some of the questions that guide our efforts are:

- How can we limit or eliminate the use of hazardous solvents?
- Can we reduce the amount of catalyst needed to carry out the reaction?
- What is the scope and limitations of the reaction?
- What is the mechanism?
- How can we leverage our understanding of the mechanism to improve the reaction?

### Metal-Catalyzed Synthesis of Heterocycles

This project explores use of palladium and gold complexes as catalysts for preparation of benzo-fused heterocycles. Our past publications focused on synthesis of benzothiophenes and benzofurans from diaryl alkynes that carry nucleophilic functional groups (sulfides, ethers, etc.). These groups can be *‘encouraged’* to engage with the alkyne in a cyclization reaction and we found that cationic gold complexes with *N*-heterocyclic carbene ligands are particularly persuasive.

We are currently looking for ways to do this chemistry in ways that aligns with the Principles of Green and Sustainable Chemistry. Our strategies include aqueous micellar media, development of robust catalysts, and combining multiple reactions into one-pot processes.
