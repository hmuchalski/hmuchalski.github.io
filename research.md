Our research aims to develop new organic reactions and synthetic strategies for preparation of small organic molecules. The molecules we make are used as agrochemicals as well as probes that help us answer questions in molecular biology.

Currently we have two main research project underway

## Gold catalysis

This project explores use of gold complexes as catalysts for a efficient addition of nucleophiles to the Câ€“C pi bond in alkynes. Some of the questions that guide our efforts are:

- What gold complexes allow for a productive reaction?
- What nucleophiles will engage in the gold-catalyzed reaction?
- What is the scope and limitations of this reaction?

## Stable sulfenic acids

Though the chemistry of organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) is well understood, the properties of their sulfur analogs, sulfenic acids (RSOH), needs further investigation. Recent discoveries suggest that sulfenic acids efficiently terminate free radical chain oxidation (autoxidation) reactions. However, the small number of sulfenic acids that are stable in solution restricts the systematic study of their antioxidant properties. The long-term objective of this project is to determine what structural elements and functional groups render sulfenic acids stable in solution.

### Isotopic Reinforcement of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Lipid peroxidation is a reaction of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with oxygen. When enzymes control this free radical-mediated process, it is an initial step of biochemical reaction cascade that produces prostaglandins, integral elements of the immune system. Uncontrolled nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation leads to highly electrophilic aldehydes and ketones that are known to initiate toxic processes that have been associated with heart disease and environmental exposures.

Site-specific isotopic reinforcement of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is a promising new approach to curtail propagation of lipid peroxidation. In these synthetic analogs of natural fatty acids, the hydrogens prone to radial attack are substituted with deuterium isotopes. Supplementation with deuterated PUFAs shows a protective effect in oxidative stress neurodegeneration models of Parkinson's disease and Friedrich's ataxia. Discovery of the full potential of deuterium-reinforced PUFAs is hindered by the lack of access to these lipids. The current synthesis is long, linear, costly, and only applicable to a large scale. We are working on a conceptually new approach to the site-specific introduction of deuterium to the bis-allylic system of the fatty acid. -->
