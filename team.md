## Hubert Muchalski, Ph.D.

<img src="/img/hm-circle2.png" width="120" />

Hubert is a native of Poland where he received his B.S./M.S. in Chemistry at [Wrocław University of Technology][pwr] in 2006. During these studies, he investigated the diselenide catalyzed hydroperoxide oxidation of naphthalenes. In 2006, he began graduate studies at Vanderbilt with [prof. Jeffrey N. Johnston][jnj]. There Hubert developed a unique a-diazo imide reagent that enabled the development of the Brønsted acid catalyzed syn-glycolate Mannich reaction. He then used the Bronsted acid-promoted azide-alkene synthesis of _vic_-amino alcohols to develop a two directional synthesis approach to (+)-zwittermicin A. Hubert was a postdoctoral scholar with prof. Ned Porter until 2015 where he investigated kinetic isotope effect of lipid peroxidation. In 2015 he joined the [Chemistry Department][csm-chem] at [Fresno State][csuf] as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry.
